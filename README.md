# Barre

Barre is a fitness website that promotes the benefits of barre fitness, a workout that combines elements of Pilates, yoga, and ballet-inspired movements. This project is inspired by my personal passion for barre, an activity I look forward to every week. Through this website, I aim to share the benefits of barre fitness and encourage others to incorporate it into their wellness routine.
